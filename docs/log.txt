It's surprising how much complexity is trying to seep into this simple tool. I must remember not to let myself get carried away.

For example, FreeType has a feature to add multiple font files to a face object, and it might be tempting to use that to get bold and italic versions of a font into a single RasterizedFont structure.

However, that could potentially be very uncomfortable if the font files are not strictly "parallel" in the sense that they carry the same glyphs in the same order: the RasterizedFont structure simply couldn't handle that.

So, keeping font variants together is a future task for a higher-level structure, perhaps to be called FontIndex or similar.
